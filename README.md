# ItsNotAnEnduranceCompetitionUCanGetUpLeave-UChoseAMediocreWhiteWoman-WhyUDidntLeave-WasntEvenWorthIt

i bet the person ure with didnt have a single person ask them out to prom YET u gave her everything, that is so crazy to me

thats so stupid honestly -- to waste my time was the goal

they would do jummah khutbahs around the world in every mosque about your story as a cautionary tale: there was once a man, who had everything he ever wanted in front of him, yet he ran away SCARED, chose a mediocre white woman to waste his time with, bar hop in bk (oh btw anyone who was successful from my hs never fking bar hopped in bk of all places) to prove to people what, who know what at this point, gave her everything, yet kept coming back to the muslim woman. in the end it wasnt even worth it, not an ounce was worth it.
