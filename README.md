# ItsNotAnEnduranceCompetitionUCanGetUpLeave-UChoseAMediocreWhiteWoman-WhyUDidntLeave-WasntEvenWorthIt

i bet the person ure with didnt have a single person ask them out to prom YET u gave her everything, that is so crazy to me

thats so stupid honestly -- to waste my time was the goal

they would do jummah khutbahs around the world in every mosque about your story as a cautionary tale: there was once a man, who had everything he ever wanted in front of him, yet he ran away SCARED, chose a mediocre white woman to waste his time with, bar hop in bk (oh btw anyone who was successful from my hs never fking bar hopped in bk of all places) to prove to people what, who know what at this point, gave her everything, yet kept coming back to the muslim woman. in the end it wasnt even worth it, not an ounce was worth it. 

what would a secular turk say? u tell me, c'mon tell me, bc i dunno if ure one of those MORONS. "ohhh islam, its outdated, we've moved past that, we're MODERN people now" yeah interesting ... bc every ounce of islam that i have ever known i used to figure this siutation out, like what to do, and what the RIGHT thing to do was and still is. dont let anyone including YOURSELF delude you into thinking its anything else than that. (ohh the zip code lottery, the genetic lottery ... nope), and im still trying to do the right thing. "ohh islam is a violent religion" yeah interesing, who is violent here? lying is violence, stalking is violence, trying to ruin my reputation is violence -- who has been doing that? 

u fked up and i have to wait for you, and the next time i see u, ure going to be at the same exact place where i left u, bolted to the floor, bc u were too afraid to leave and do something else BETTER. its not an endurance competition to be MISERABLE u dont win a prize to be miserable. and now what ure doing is keeping me CONFUSED so i stay gullible. im not a desperate person and i never was.

i live with my parents, i make them happy, bc i have make my parents happy in islam, and i have to listen to them, if they dont like you, then that's it, im going to listen to them bc they are wise ppl.

if i was assigned to be in a group project with the person ure with (fighting tooth and nail for all these yrs, showed me attitude on the phone for, asshole), id fking do the ENTIRE project myself, and tell that person "dont worry about it" and never keep in touch with that person after the project is over. i dont think that person would be in the same classes as me tho.

the downfall for a man, any man, is a mediocre woman. and the downfall for a woman, any woman, is a mediocre man.
